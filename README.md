## Hello!

It's me! One of those guys with a weird obsession with old things (but mostly electronic).

I'm interested in retro computing, hardware, kubernetes, analog photography and much more. I'm also active in my local hackerspace [hackeriet](https://hackeriet.no/) and the pinball club [Oslo Pinball Club](https://www.oslopinball.no/)

You will find me as heplaphon in most places where I'm active.

üïπÔ∏è From my retro computing I currently have in my possesion
* Commodore 64
* Commodore Amiga 500
* ABC 80

üì∑ As for my analog photography I have
* Pentax ME Super (Main camera)
* Minolta 7s
* Agfa Isolette I (120 format)
* Canon Autoboy Luna XL (Point & Shoot)
